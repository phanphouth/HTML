        This list of the 100 most common vocabulary words in English can be used as a reference for beginner English students. It's a good idea to master these words fully before trying to move on to less common words, since this is the vocabulary you will encounter most often. These are some of the first words that native English speaking children learn how to spell. You can also make sure that you not only recognize these words and know how to pronounce them, but that you can also spell them correctly. Mistakes in spelling these short, common words are more significant than mistakes spelling more complicated words you may learn later on.
